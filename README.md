# AWS-BASICS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform that offers over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. AWS provides a range of services in various domains, including computing power, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, security, and application development. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some of its key components and features:

Compute Services:

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud. It allows users to run applications on virtual machines.
Lambda: A serverless computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required.
ECS (Elastic Container Service) and EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Services for running containerized applications using Docker or Kubernetes.
Storage Services:

S3 (Simple Storage Service): Scalable object storage with high durability and availability, often used for backup and archiving, data lakes, and application hosting.
EBS (Elastic Block Store): Provides persistent block storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
Glacier: Low-cost archival storage for data that is infrequently accessed.
Database Services:

RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational database service supporting various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.
DynamoDB: Fully managed NoSQL database service designed for high performance and scalability.
Redshift: Data warehousing service designed for large-scale data analysis.
Networking Services:

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Enables users to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network.
Route 53: Scalable domain name system (DNS) web service for domain registration and routing internet traffic.
CloudFront: Content delivery network (CDN) that delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users with low latency.
Security and Identity Services:

IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manages access to AWS services and resources securely.
KMS (Key Management Service): Simplifies the creation and control of encryption keys.
Shield: Managed DDoS protection service to safeguard applications.
Analytics and Machine Learning:

Athena: Interactive query service to analyze data in S3 using SQL.
EMR (Elastic MapReduce): Big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open-source tools such as Apache Hadoop and Spark.
SageMaker: Fully managed service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.
Developer and Management Tools:

CloudFormation: Service for modeling and setting up AWS resources using templates.
CloudWatch: Monitoring and management service for operational and performance data.
CodePipeline: Continuous integration and delivery service for fast and reliable application updates.
IoT and Mobile Services:

IoT Core: Managed cloud service that allows connected devices to interact with cloud applications.
AWS Amplify: Tools and services to help front-end web and mobile developers build full-stack applications.
Business Applications:

WorkSpaces: Managed, secure cloud desktop service.
Chime: Communications service for online meetings and video conferencing.
Marketplace and Ecosystem:

AWS Marketplace: Online store for finding, buying, and deploying software and services that run on AWS.
AWS operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing businesses to scale their infrastructure up or down based on demand without upfront capital expenditures. This flexibility, combined with the breadth of services and global reach, makes AWS a dominant player in the cloud computing industry.
